#### Basic example: play a single note

```js
import { Synthetizer } from "spessasynth_lib"

const sfont = await (await fetch("soundfont.sf3")).arrayBuffer();
const ctx = new AudioContext();
// make sure you copied the worklet processor!
await ctx.audioWorklet.addModule("./worklet_processor.min.js");
const synth = new Synthetizer(ctx.destination, sfont);
document.getElementById("button").onclick = async () =>
{
    await ctx.resume();
    synth.programChange(0, 48); // strings ensemble
    synth.noteOn(0, 52, 127);
}
```

#### Read and write DLS Level One or Two files
  - Read DLS (DownLoadable Sounds) files as SF2 files!
  - **Works like a normal soundfont:** *Saving it as sf2 is still [just one function!](https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth/wiki/SoundFont2-Class#write)*
  - Converts articulators to both **modulators** and **generators**!
  - Works with both unsigned 8-bit samples and signed 16-bit samples!
