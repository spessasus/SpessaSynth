- Play MIDI files using SF2/SF3/DLS files
- Write MIDI files
- Write SF2/SF3 files
- Convert DLS to SF2 (and back)
- [and more!](#easy-integration)

### npm package

### Export MIDI as WAV
  - Save the MIDI file as WAV audio!
  - **Metadata support:** *Embed metadata such as title, artist, album and more!*
  - **Cue points:** *Write MIDI loop points as cue points!*
  - **Loop multiple times:** *Render two (or more) loops into the file for seamless transitions!*
  - *That's right, saving as WAV is also [just one function!](https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth/wiki/Writing-Wave-Files#audiobuffertowav)*

## Limitations
- Synth's performance may be suboptimal, especially on mobile devices.
- [SF2 to DLS Conversion](https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth/wiki/DLS-Conversion-Problem)
- Audio may sometimes sound distorted in Chrome, Edge, Brave,
  etc. due to a **[Chromium Bug](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/367304685).**
  I can't do anything about it, only hope that it gets fixed.
  Please consider voting for it on the bug tracker to get it fixed!

### Installation (Local Edition)
Local edition comes with easier soundfont management than the demo version.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Firefox is recommended due to Chromium's Web Audio bug and memory limit.
> A decent computer is also recommended for handling large SoundFonts.

[Recommended high-quality SoundFont (better than the built-in one)](https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/1176)

**Local Edition requires Node.js**

#### Windows
1. Download the code as a ZIP file and extract, or use `git clone https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth`.
2. Put your SoundFonts into the `soundfonts` folder (you can select SoundFonts in the program).
3. Double-click `Open SpessaSynth.bat`.
4. Enjoy!

#### Linux
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth --depth 1
   cd SpessaSynth
   npm start
   ```
2. Put your SoundFonts into the `soundfonts` folder (you can select SoundFonts in the program).
3. Enjoy!

[If you would like to help translate SpessaSynth, please read this guide (and thank you!)](src/website/js/locale/locale_files/README.md)

**If you like this project, consider giving it a star. It really helps out!**

#### TODO
- Improve the performance of the worklet system
