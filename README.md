### Downloading the Local Edition
Local edition comes with easier soundfont management than the demo version,
also allowing to use it offline!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Firefox is recommended due to Chromium's Web Audio bug and memory limit.
> A decent computer is also recommended for handling large SoundFonts.

[Recommended high-quality SoundFont (better than the built-in one)](https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts/1176)

**Local Edition requires Node.js**

#### Windows
1. [Download the program](https://spessasus.github.io/SpessaSynth/SpessaSynth-LocalEdition.zip).
2. Put your SoundFonts and DLS files into the `soundfonts` folder (you can select sound banks in the program).
3. Double-click `Open SpessaSynth.bat` (or you can type `node server/server.js` in the Command Prompt)
4. Enjoy!

#### Linux
1. [Download the program](https://spessasus.github.io/SpessaSynth/SpessaSynth-LocalEdition.zip).
2. Put your SoundFonts and DLS files into the `soundfonts` folder (you can select sound banks in the program).
3. `node server/server.js`
4. Enjoy!

### Building from source
```shell
# clone
git clone "https://github.com/spessasus/SpessaSynth" --depth 1
# install dependencies
npm i
# build and start the local edition
npm start
```
The "start" will automatically build the script and then invoke server.js. 
Then it will only invoke server.js so you need to `npm run build` to rebuild.

The build files:
- dist: the online demo along with the bundled Local edition ZIP for downloading. This is what's hosted on GH pages.
- local-dev: Local Edition sources with sourcemaps. For development.
- server: the Local Edition server. It is here so it can use the root "soundfonts" folder. This is what `npm start` invokes.
